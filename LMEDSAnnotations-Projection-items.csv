And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal. Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet.
